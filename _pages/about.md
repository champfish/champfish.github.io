Currently, I am a doctoral student at Northwestern University. I work in the [Physical Electronics Research Laboratory](https://sites.google.com/view/perlab/home?authuser=0) under Dr. Pedram Khalili.

I graduated summa cum laude from The University of Texas at Dallas with a B.S. and M.S. in Electrical Engineering. There I studied the creation of various neural network architectures using spintronic technology under [Dr. Joseph Friedman](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~joseph.friedman/).

My non-acedemic interests include bowling, coding, grand strategy games, hiking, history and anything else that can distract me from work.
